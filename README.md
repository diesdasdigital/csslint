# lint-css

Linter for our CSS architecture

### Css rules it checks:

- [x] no type selectors (with the only exception `> tag`)
- [x] no id selectors
- [x] component name is used on every class as a prefix
- [x] no multiple nesting in class names, eg `.component__one__two` is ill-formed
- [x] animation names should start with the component name: `@keyframes my-component__my-animation { ...`
